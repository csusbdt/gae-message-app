<h1>GAE Message App Test</h1>

<p>
The following form sends a delete-message request to the message application
running on localhost.
The delete should fail because the CSRF token is not sent.
</p>

<p>
To run the test, open this file in a browser in which you are logged into the
message app.  Then click the button to win $100.
</p>

<form action="http://localhost:8888/delete-message" method="post">
  <input type="submit" value="Click here to win $100" />
</form>
